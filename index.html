            <h2 class="headings" style="position: absolute; left: 100px;">What is Stress?</h2>
            <img src="https://www.verywellhealth.com/thmb/71dvtkVttyKR5BfN6xqMlqfPLtI=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1132122136-f6895ecc887f4617a133a01799d69e03.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 300px; border: 3px solid white; position:relative; left: 150px; top: 150px;">
            <p class="paragraph" style="position: relative; left: 500px; bottom: 70px;">Stress is something that impacts everyone. <br> It can make people worry about certain things more than usual, <br> it can also cause certain health conditions and symptoms to <br> occur because people are carrying too much pressure under their shoulders. <br> Stress, for most people, is an underlying pressure that people <br> feel that can make them feel nervous or have a lot to do and don't <br> have a lot of time to do it, so they <br> in other words, they feel overwhelmed.</p>


            <h1 class="headings" style="text-align: center;">How To Deal With Stress</h1>
            <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: left; position: relative; left: 15px;">People can deal with stress in many different ways, but the first thing you should do before you even try to get rid of stress is try to identify the thing that is causing you stress, because once the problem is isolated, it is easier for you to come up with or use strategies that will target that specific problem and resolve it, because every problem causes a different type/level of stress, thus you have to use the strategy that is right for you and the type of problems you are dealing with.</p>
            <h1 class="headings" style="position: relative; left: 100px;">Deep Breathing</h1>
            <p class="paragraph" style="position: relative; left: 500px; position: relative;">One of the best strategies I have learned to <br> use for my stress is to practice breathing <br> exercises and get lots of physical activity, <br> particularly outside. This strategy really works <br> because practicing breathing exercises slows <br> your heart rate down and forces your body to <br> enter a relaxing state, relieving the tension <br> caused by stress that can build up inside.</p>

            <h1 class="headings" style="position: relative; bottom: 150px; left: 100px;">Physcial Activity</h1>
            <img src="https://wallpaperaccess.com/full/9019447.jpg" style="border: 3px solid white; height: 200px; width: 300px; position: relative; left: 150px; bottom: 150px;">
            <p class="paragraph" style="position: relative; bottom: 340px; left: 500px;">Getting physical activity is also important because it is good for your <br> body to stay healthy and in shape. Being more active gets your blood <br> pumping, increasing brain stimulation and increasing overall performance, <br> which will put you in a better mood due to the extra brain stimulation. </p>
            <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: left; position: relative; bottom: 200px;">Most people get stressed from their work, the people they work with, or just the environment that surrounds them. For example, if you are a computer programmer and you are working with five other people and you do all of your work, but the people around you don’t do anything, and your boss wants your final project done in 3 days, you will most likely get stressed because of the pressure that’s going to be on you, considering what your boss is going to do when he finds out the project is nowhere near done.</p>
            <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: left; position: relative; bottom: 200px;">In this situation, I would do some deep breathing exercises, to try and calm down and think of a way that me and my team can resolve the problem together. Allowing yourself to take more time to do things and figure things out step by step is an essential way to make it seem like you are not in a rush anymore and you have the floor to think things out in a clearer way, putting your mind and your body at ease.
            </p>

            <h1 class="headings" style="text-align: center; position: relative; bottom: 190px;">Team Building</h1>
            <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: left; position: relative; bottom: 200px;">For team building skills, you will need to focus on being able to communicate your ideas out to people in a clear and easy way, that way they know what you know and they can use your knowledge as a reference for their own work. I found that being able to communicate clearly is what will make your team become more understandable in terms of work and reasoning. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: left; position: relative; bottom: 200px;">For example, if you are in a sales meeting with your team, and they are bringing up prices for collateral that they want to charge, and you want to make them aware of a problem with their pricing, you have to express your opinion and show them what you mean using your reasoning, and by putting them into your perspective so they see the world from where you are. 
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph" style="text-align: left; position: relative; bottom: 200px;">That’s just one way you could go about creating team building skills, but there are many others too. Before you try to use any strategy for increasing your team building skills, you also want to look at the kind of team that you have, and the strengths and weaknesses of each person on your team. This will help you determine who should do what and how to explain things to them so that they understand just like everyone else.</p>

            <h1 class="headings" style="position: relative; left: 650px; bottom: 200px;">Organization/Analysis</h1>
            <img src="https://coolwallpapers.me/picsup/3003437-advice_advise_advisor_business_collaboration_company_coworker_discussing_discussion_group_meeting_notes_office_people_seminar_staff_startup_talk_talking_team_teamwork_working_.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 300px; border: 3px solid white; position: relative; left: 1100px; bottom: 200px;">
            <p class="paragraph" style="position: relative; bottom: 450px; left: 340px;">One strategy that I like to use to increase my team building skills <br> is to manage my time wisely and look at what <br> people on your team can do and assign them jobs to be fulfilled in <br> that amount of time. This is a way of keeping things <br> organized, so that when everybody goes to work, they all can complete <br> their tasks in a timely manner and come together <br> with the final product. You could also call this strategy “keeping organized” <br> because organization is KEY to ensuring that <br> everything is done securely and also so that people are forced to know what <br> they are doing, unless they want to be talked to <br> by the leader of the team.
                Thus, it’s a way to keep things neat and understandable.

            <h1 class="headings" style="position: relative; left: 520px; bottom: 400px;">Giving/Recieving Feedback</h1>
            <img src="https://blog.appfolio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/blog_3.15_1140x641-1140x641.jpg" style="height: 200px; width: 300px; border: 3px solid white; position: relative; bottom: 400px; left: 1100px;">
            <p class="paragraph" style="position: relative; bottom: 630px; left: 200px;">Another strategy I like to use to build team skills is to give feedback and receive feedback <br> from other people. This strategy is really good, because it opens your eyes up to things that <br> you might not have known about a certain topic, or something that you haven’t noticed <br> before about something you’ve been looking at. Also, this strategy brings in a certain level of <br> communication and socialization too, thereby initializing chatting standards and different types <br> of languages that are used daily when discussing things with a team, therefore shaping your <br> speech and vocabulary in a positive way too. If you’re the one giving feedback to someone else, <br> then it might be good for them because maybe you know something that they don’t that could <br> help them with what they’re doing on the team, and vice versa goes for you and the rest of the team. </p>
